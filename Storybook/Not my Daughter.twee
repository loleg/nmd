:: A crisp morning {"position":"275,375","size":"100,100"}
It is a crisp morning in Dar Gyi Jar, as Ata wakes up for his morning routine. He is a simple man of modest means, but he is caught up in a terrible spiral of ethnic hate with cycles of violence that span generations. Mobile phones, social media, and artificial intelligence have now become part of a technological arsenal, reigniting the cycle of violence in the region.

The Rohingya people are a Muslim ethnic minority group who have lived for centuries in predominantly Buddhist Myanmar - despite this, the Rohingya are not recognized as an official ethnic group and are the worldâ€™s largest stateless population.

:: Ata's Story {"position":"275,275","size":"100,100"}
In the small village where Rohingya families lived in Myanmar, there was a young man named Ata Tun. His opportunities to develop were limited due to his lack of citizenship status, which meant he could not attend school or work legally. Political instability and lack of economic prospects led him down a dark path, that he would later come to regret.

:: First Target {"position":"450,625","size":"100,100"}
Ata Tun's first victim was a young girl named Huma. She had dreams of going to school but knew the odds were stacked against her. When she met Ata online, she saw him as an opportunity for friendship and support. Little did she know that he would use their relationship to exploit her in unimaginable ways.

:: Grooming {"position":"625,475","size":"100,100"}
Using various digital platforms and tools, Ata Tun began to groom Huma and other young Rohingya women by building relationships based on false promises of love, support, and companionship. He used these connections to coerce them into performing explicit acts, which he recorded and shared without their consent. This not only caused immense psychological harm but also exposed them to further risks, including blackmail and extortion attempts from others who gained access to the content.

Huma, like many other Rohingya girls, faced numerous challenges growing up in a community where access to education was limited and opportunities for personal growth were scarce. As a Muslim ethnic minority without citizenship or proper legal protections, she was particularly susceptible to exploitation and abuse.

:: Network Ops {"position":"275,575","size":"100,100"}
The network operated like a well-oiled machine, with members sharing information about vulnerable people they encountered daily. They would use social engineering tactics, such as pretending to be someone else or manipulating emotions, to gain trust and exploit their victims. Ata Tun quickly became adept at this craft, using his charm and good looks to lure unsuspecting women into a false sense of security.

:: Target Girls {"position":"275,675","size":"100,100"}
He began targeting Rohingya girls who were even more vulnerable due to the lack of opportunities available to them in their community. The isolation they felt made it easier for Ata Tun to manipulate them, convincing them that he was someone they could trust and confide in. With indoctrination from a local gang, the village boy Ata quickly became part of a mob with a digital stick financed by the region's militia.
