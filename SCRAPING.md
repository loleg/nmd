For Scraping News Reports and Legal Cases on Tech-Enabled Gender Based Violence

_Objective: To collect data on tech-enabled gender based violence (TEGBV) from news reports and legal cases worldwide, in order to assist non-profit organizations in their efforts to track its prevalence._

Materials Needed:

1. A computer or laptop with internet access
2. Web browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
3. Data collection tool (e.g., web scraper, browser extension) such as Scrapy, Beautiful Soup, or ParseHub
4. Text editor or spreadsheet software (e.g., Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets)
5. Database management system (optional but recommended)

Instructions:

#### Step 1: Define your search parameters

1. Determine the time frame you want to focus on (e.g., past five years).
2. Choose specific countries or regions where you will concentrate your research.
3. Identify keywords related to TEGBV, such as "cyberstalking," "revenge pornography," "sextortion," etc.

#### Step 2: Locate reliable sources

1. Search for reputable online news outlets that cover global events and legal developments. Examples include BBC, CNN, The Guardian, Al Jazeera, and local newspapers in targeted countries.
2. Identify relevant legal databases, such as LexisNexis, Westlaw, or CourtListener, which may contain case files involving TEGBV incidents.

#### Step 3: Set up your data collection tool

1. Install a web scraper or browser extension compatible with your chosen sources.
2. Configure the tool to extract relevant information, including date, source, location, type of incident, victim demographics, perpetrator details, and any legal actions taken.

#### Step 4: Begin scraping

1. Start collecting data by inputting your predefined search parameters into the web scraper or browser extension.
2. Allow the tool to crawl through pages and extract the required information. This process may take several hours or days depending on the volume of content.

#### Step 5: Organize and analyze the collected data

1. Import the extracted data into a text editor or spreadsheet program.
2. Clean and organize the data, ensuring consistency in formatting and categorization.
3. Analyze the data to identify patterns, trends, and potential correlations between different factors.

#### Step 6: Store and manage the database

1. Consider using a database management system to store and maintain the collected data. This can help streamline future analyses and updates.
2. Regularly update the database with new findings to ensure accuracy and relevance.

#### Step 7: Share your results

1. Collaborate with non-profit organizations working on TEGBV issues to share your findings and contribute to their efforts.
2. Publish your research in academic journals, conference presentations, or online platforms to raise awareness about the issue and inform policy discussions.

Remember to respect privacy concerns and ethical considerations when conducting this research. Always obtain necessary permissions from websites before scraping their content, and avoid disclosing sensitive personal information about victims.
